# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct defines proper behavior and responsibilities for contributing and participating in FOSS communities to foster an open and welcoming culture that encourages active participation, learning, and constructive interaction.

## Behavior

Participants are expected to contribute and participate in FOSS communities in a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual identity and orientation, religion, disability, illness, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nationality, age, level of experience, or education.

Examples of expected behavior to create a positive culture and environment:

- Being nice, friendly, welcoming, and inclusive
- Acting considerate, modest, and respectful
- Criticizing constructively and accepting constructive criticism
- Respecting different points of view and individual experiences
- Encouraging collaboration
- Being mindful and empathetic towards others
- Focusing on benefits for the community
- Using polite and inclusive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated:

- Intimidating others
- Political or personal attacks, as well as publishing private information without permission (e.g., an address)
- Trolling
- Using sexualized language
- Insulting, derogatory, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments
- Harassment

## Responsibilities

By contributing and participating in FOSS communities, all individuals are obliged to comply with this Code of Conduct. Contributors are expected to respect internationally recognized human rights and promote adherence to them.

Community maintainers are responsible for defining values, implementing rules for proper behavior, and taking appropriate and corrective actions in cases of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the authority to reject, edit, or remove contributions (e.g., comments, source code commits, and discussion entries) in the community. They may, but are not obliged to, explain why an individual's behavior negatively impacted others and issue warnings in public or private. Maintainers may also ban participants with inappropriate behavior temporarily or permanently.

## Enforcement

To uphold the values of proper behavior, this Code of Conduct must be enforced. Any irregularity (e.g., unacceptable behavior) should be reported to the designated contact for the community. After a report is made, the complaint will be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.
