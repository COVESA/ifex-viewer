# What is the IFEX Viewer?

The IFEX Viewer displays API specifications created with the Interface Exchange Framework ([IFEX](https://github.com/COVESA/ifex)). It is designed to be easily integrated into any framework as a versatile web component.

The Viewer supports rendering everything specified in the [IFEX Core IDL](https://covesa.github.io/ifex/ifex-specification).

Additionally to the Core IDL, the Viewer supports custom and deployment layers within your specifications and visualizes them accordingly.
